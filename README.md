# steam_bot
Bot that posts newly released Steam VR games to Discord webhooks

I made this for my own Discord server, you can use it, but there's no real support here. 

It's hard coded to load ALL new SteamVR releases, but can be modified, the only things that are configurable are which webhooks to use, because I don't want that in a public repository.

Written for Node.JS in TypeScript.
